# Code challenge
# Module 5: Programming
# User defined functions

# Solution:

# Instructions:

# 1) Create a function named "subtraction".
# 2) The function has two numeric inputs "a" and "b" (arguments).
# 3) The function calculates the difference between numbers "b" and "a".
# 4) At the end use your function to calculate the difference between numbers 11564 and 1578.

subtraction <- function(a,b){
  return(b-a)
}

subtraction(a = 1578, b = 11564)
